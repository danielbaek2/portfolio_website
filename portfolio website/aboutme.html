                Hi, my name is Daniel Eungyeol Baek, and I am currently a third-year computer science 
                student studying at the Rochester Institute of Technology for my Bachelor's Degree in 
                science. 
            </p>

                Aside from coding, I am an adamand basketball fan. I enjoy playing with my 
                friends and watching my favorite team, the <em>Houston Rockets</em>. It 
                should be noted that the outcome of their games directly impacts my mood for 
                the next couple of hours. When Game 7 of the 2018 Western Conference Finals 
                is mentioned, I get extreme PTSD and will become very sad in response to 
                such horrid memories. Generally though, for most other sports, I am a 
                casual sports fan and only watch when it is on the television, like football 
                or the World Cup as a couple of examples. While I won't be as engaged 
                when talking about basketball, I will likely be aware of what's
                taking place in the specific league.
            </p>

                My main passion/hobby is art, however, whether it be drawing or creating 
                videos. When I was younger, I always wanted to work in the film industry and,
                for the longest time, animation was my dream, seeming as I could intertwine 
                my love for drawing with my love for filmmaking; however, as the industry 
                declined with the pandemic, I transitioned into something more manageable and
                future-proof, like computer science. Now, I'm creating videos to scratch this 
                itch I still have, making video essays about films that I love and, 
                eventually, short films that I can proudly share with the world.
